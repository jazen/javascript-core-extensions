=== Javascript Core Extensions

A collection of extensions to builtin objects and extra objects/functions
easing the Javascript experience :)

== 1. How to use

Just include the files you need. You can ignore spec/ and vendor/ as they
are the testsuite.

Open spec/suite.html in your favourite browser to check if everything's fine. 

== 2. Builtin objects

= Number

* second(s)
* minute(s)
* hour(s)
* day(s)
* week(s)
* month(s)
* year(s)

= Date

* distance_of_time_in_words (not ready yet)

= String

* trim

= Array

* first, last

== 3. Extra objects

= Time

* current_date
* now
  

More to come.
